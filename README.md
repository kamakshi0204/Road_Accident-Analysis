# 1. Introduction
This project focused on analyzing road accidents data for the years 2021 and 2022. The main objective was to create an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides insights into road accident trends, casualties, accident severity, vehicle types, and other relevant factors. This dashboard aims to help stakeholders gain a comprehensive understanding of road safety performance and identify areas that require attention and improvement.

# 2. Problem Statement
Road accidents are a significant public safety concern, and understanding the patterns and contributing factors behind accidents is crucial for devising effective measures to reduce casualties and improve road safety. The problem addressed in this project was to analyze and visualize the road accident data to answer the following key questions:

Which vehicle types were involved in the highest number of accidents and casualties?
What were the trends in road accidents and casualties on a monthly basis?
How did the number of casualties vary across different road types?
What is the distribution of casualties based on accident severity?
How did the casualties differ between urban and rural areas and in different light conditions?
Which day of the week witnessed the highest and lowest number of accidents?
# 3. Data wrangling and Preprocessing
To ensure the accuracy and usability of the road accidents data, several data transformation steps were performed:

Handling Missing Values: Missing values were identified and imputed.
Removing Duplicates: Duplicated records were removed to avoid inaccuracies in the analysis.
Data Modelling: The dataset was structured and modeled in a way that allowed for easy integration into the Power BI dashboard. Relevant data columns were selected and organized to support various visualizations.
#4. Data Analysis and Visualization
The data analysis and visualization were carried out through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The dashboard incorporated various KPIs and insightful graphs to present the findings effectively:

## 4.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
### 1.Total Casualties and Total Accidents for Current Year and total Growth from Previous Year.
### 2.Total Casualties By Accident Severity for Current Year and Growth from Previous Year.
### 3.Total Casualties with Respect to Vehicle Type for Current Year.

# 5. Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed to further enhance road safety:

Increase Awareness: Launch targeted awareness campaigns to educate drivers about safe driving practices, particularly on high-risk days like Saturdays.
Improve Infrastructure: Focus on improving road infrastructure, especially on Single Carriageways, to reduce accident rates.
Monitor Urban Areas: Pay attention to urban areas and implement measures to improve road safety in those regions.
Continuous Monitoring: Regularly update and monitor road accidents data to assess the effectiveness of implemented measures and make data-driven decisions.
By implementing these recommendations, stakeholders can work towards reducing casualties, promoting road safety, and creating a safer environment for all road users. The interactive Power BI dashboard provides an efficient tool to track progress and make informed decisions for road safety improvement initiatives.
